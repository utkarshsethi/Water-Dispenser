### Notes

1. The cost of the Aquasana filtration system fluctuates quite a bit. Watch for sales or promotions to get it for $99. 
2. The filtration kit came with some plumbing fittings, so all fittings used on project are not listed. 
3. Many components were purchased from my local electronics store so links to products may not reflect where I actually bought the product.
4. Some items were purchased in bulk but the cost reflects only the items that were required for the project.
5. The cost for parts I scavenged from around the house were not included.
