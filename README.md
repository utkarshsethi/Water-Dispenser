## Automatic Filtered Water Dispenser



The purpose of this project was to create a water filtration system that dispenses water automatically when a glass is placed under the tap.



Goals

1. Detect when a glass is under the tap and dispense water automatically. When the glass is pulled back, the system should turn off and allow water to finish draining into the glass.
2. Log water usage to keep track of how much water I am drinking each day.
3. Alert me when it is time to change the filter
